"""
Keeps a workspace's context.md short (methodology 12.2; technique-workspaces.md section 7).

    python scripts/compact_context.py <workspace> [--keep N]            dry run: what would move, and the size
    python scripts/compact_context.py <workspace> [--keep N] --apply    move it

context.md is the session's current state, not its history. In the sections `Current state`, `Execution point` and
`Work done`, an entry that starts with a date in its first line (`**29.10.2026 ...**`, `**L43 (29.10.2026 ...)**`,
`- 29.10.2026: ...`) belongs to the past once it is not one of the newest N (default 5, newest by the date written).
Those entries move, word for word, to `archive/context/context_archive_<YYYYMMDD>.md`, and a one-line pointer stays in
their section. Everything else stays where it is: the other sections (decisions, open questions, blockers, pending
work, validation, the tickets block), every entry without a date (a how-to-resume block) and every byte outside the
moved entries. An entry that mentions a rule or a decision is listed apart, to be checked against `Decisions made`
before the move is trusted.

--apply first copies the whole file to `archive/context/context_<stamp>_before.md` (the way back), then writes under the
workspace's lock, atomically. Nothing in `history/`, the run logs or the evidence is read or written, and a path that
leaves the workspace is refused. Running it again with nothing older than the newest N changes nothing.

Exit codes: 0 done (or dry run) · 1 another process is writing the workspace · 2 usage (no context.md, a path refused)
